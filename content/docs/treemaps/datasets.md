_(legacy)_ datasets come from [[1]](https://github.com/vissoft18/treemaps) and [[3]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8019841/?reload=true).

## Dataset extraction
#### GitHub

The dataset selection (for those named `gh-*`) was done through the scrapping of the first 10 pages of [gitmostwanted.com](http://gitmostwanted.com/), which is a website that lists popular GitHub repositories.

For the selected URLs (list can be found [here](https://github.com/EduardoVernier/dataset-generator/blob/master/GitHubMostWanted/repos.txt)), we run a python script that clones revisions of a repository with a given periodicity. For this batch, we used monthly extractions (-m), but the script takes a flag as argument that selects if it should clone yearly (-y), daily (-d), or all revisions (-a).

For each cloned revision, the script invokes the [CLOC tool](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc) to list and count the number of lines of code in each source file. This is a faster free alternative to Understand.

Datasets are named as `gh-<name_of_repository>-<periodicity>`.

Ex.: _gh-svgo-m_ for the github.com/svg/svgo repository with last commit of month extraction (-m).

The scripts and notebooks used for scrapping, metric collection and file generation can be found [here](https://github.com/EduardoVernier/dataset-generator/tree/master/GitHubMostWanted).

The datasets that are named `GitHub*` where borrowed from previous works ([[1]](https://github.com/sibgrapi18/treemaps) and [[2]](https://github.com/vissoft18/treemaps)) that evaluated dynamic treemaps. gh\* datasets were extracted in July 16, 2018. GitHub* datasets were extracted in May, 2017.


#### WorldBank

The WorldBank Group offers an open database with hundreds of indicators of global development. Their measurements can be downloaded as a large [csv file](http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/WDI_csv.zip).

Based on that, each indicator that has a minimum number of observations is turned into a dataset for our application. Each row in the original data represents one _Region/Country_ entry and the columns give the indicator value for that entry in a given year. There is one column for each year since the first time the indicator was measured.

Datasets are named `wb-<indicator_id>`, where the _indicator_id_ is a unique code that maps to one global indicator.

For example: _wb-TX.VAL.MMTL.ZS.UN_ corresponds to "Ores and metals exports (% of merchandise exports)" and _wb-EN.URB.MCTY.TL.ZS_ corresponds to "Population in urban agglomerations of more than 1 million (% of total population)".

**The mapping of indicator ids to dataset descriptions can be found [here](https://github.com/EduardoVernier/dataset-generator/blob/master/WorldBank/id_indicator_map.csv)**.

Addtional information about datasets can be found [here](https://github.com/EduardoVernier/dataset-generator/blob/master/WorldBank/wb-series.csv) with descriptions, information about periodicity, aggregation method, limitations and exceptions, statistical concept and methodology, source, license type, etc. These datasets were extracted in July 4, 2018.

#### TMDB

The raw dataset contains over 20 million reviews about 27,278 movies.
Each user review of a movie has a rating (value from 0 to 5) and a timestamp of when it was posted. The first reviews date to January 1995 and the last to March 2015.
Each movie has an id, year of release and a list of genres it belongs to (sorted alphabetically).
To extract 100+ datasets from this source I defined 4 levels of freedom (hierarchy, cell weight, time aggregation, filters). In bold are the keys that are used to identify the datasets.

* Hierarchy
  * Using genre information. 0 to 7 levels (some movies don't have this info) **[genre]** - Ex.:_Adventure/Animation/Children/Comedy/ToyStory_
  * Using year information. Always two levels. **[year]** - Ex.:_1995/ToyStory_
* Cell weight
  * Number of reviews in a given period.  **[count]**
  * Average rating in a given period.  **[average]**
  * Review standard deviation in a given period. **[std]**
* Time aggregation by review timestamp
  * Aggregate monthly (~240 months or revisions).   **[monthly]**
  * Aggregate yearly (~20 years or revisions).   **[yearly]**
* Filters
  * Only action movies.  **[action]**
  * Only children movies.  **[children]**
  * Only documentaries.  **[documentary]**
  * Only movies from 60s, 70s and 80's.  **[60sto80s]**
  * Only movies from 90s.  **[90s]**
  * Only movies from 2000 onwards. **[00stonow]**
  * Only movies with 4 or more genres.  **[4plusngeres]**
  * Only movies without genre info.  **[nogenre]**
  * 2000 randomly selected movies.  **[2krand]**

This gives us 2 * 3 * 2 * 9 = 108 datasets. Datasets are named `tmdb-<periodicity>-<weight_value>-<hierarchy_type>-<filter>`.

For example:
_tmbd-monthly-mean-genres-documentaries_ gives the average monthly rating for documentaries using the genre hierarchy and _tmbd-yearly-count-release-90s_ counts the number of reviews 90s titles received during each year using the hierarchy given by Year/Title.

The code that generated the datasets is available [here](https://github.com/EduardoVernier/dataset-generator/tree/master/TMDB). The datasets were generated July 14, 2018.

#### Movielens
The MovieLens database. This database contains 45,000 movies, 750,000 keywords attached to these movies, and 26 million time-stamped 0 to 5 star ratings over roughly 22 years. The naming convention for these files is as follows:

`Movies<hierachical><cumulative><collection_period><aggregation_period>`

If the name contains the H of _\<hierarchical\>_ we have a fixed 4 level hierarchy.

We first partitioned on the genres Crime, Adventure and Drama;
second on the movie release date (before vs after 2010); third on the tags Ford, Pitt, Depp, Hanks, Stewart, Cooper, Grant, and Flynn; fourth on whether the movie title contains the word Act, War, Love, Time, Spirit, Night, or any other word; fifth on whether tags contain Friend, Enemy or neither/both; and finally on whether tags contain Past, Future or neither/both. This results in a very deep hierarchy with a large imbalance in the tree depths.

If the name does not contains the H of _\<hierarchical\>_ it is a dataset consisting of only a single level. In this case we only considered movies with genres Action and Adventure to trim down the sheer amount of movies.

If the name contains the C of _\<cumulative\>_ it means we consider all ratings from the start of the collection period until now. Otherwise we only consider the ratings in the current aggregation period.

The _\<collection_period\>_ indicates over how long a period we are collecting the data. The _\<aggregation_period\>_ indicates how much time passes between two samples. _Y_ indicates a year, _M_ indicates a month, _D_ indicates a day, _H_ indicates an hour.

A few examples are: _Movies15M1D, Movies3Y3M, MoviesC4Y90H, MoviesH22Y7M, MoviesHC10Y2M._

The datasets were generated February 10, 2018.

#### Flattened datasets
Datasets prefixed by `f-*` have been flattened. They come from the same sources mentioned previously but they have no hierarchy in the data, that is, the tree has depth equals to 1.
